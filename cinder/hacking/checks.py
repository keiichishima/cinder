Guidelines for writing new hacking checks

 - Use only for Cinder specific tests. OpenStack general tests
   should be submitted to the common 'hacking' module.
 - Pick numbers in the range N3xx. Find the current test with
   the highest allocated number and then pick the next value.
 - Keep the test method code in the source file ordered based
   on the N3xx value.
 - List the new rule in the top level HACKING.rst file
 - Add test cases for each new rule to
   cinder/tests/unit/test_hacking.py

    we shouldn't translate debug level logs.

    * This check assumes that 'LOG' is a logger.
    * Use filename so we can start enforcing this in specific folders instead
      of needing to do so all at once.
